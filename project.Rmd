Research Description: Natural history collections are vital sources of primary biological material, being utilized in a variety of studies across evolutionary biology, pathology, and ecotoxicology, among other disciplines (Lister et al. 2011, McClean et al. 2016, Rutledge & Barve in press ). Providing insight into temporal and spatial trends across species, collections are vital for understanding how species and populations change over time, patterns that lay the foundation for conservation practices (Winker et al. 1991, Pyke & Ehrlich 2010, Rutledge & Barve in press). However, to maintain such records of past and present of biological diversity, constant addition to collections is necessary. Normally done via active collecting, current specimen collection has decreased noticeably in the past few decades, with many museums abstaining from this practice altogether (Sweet 2010, Schultz et al. 2021). Fueling this decrease is a simultaneous increase in public and professional resistance to collecting birds for research purposes, resistance that in turn hampers attempts by museums to obtain collecting permits (Sweet 2010).  Consequently, many museums have turned to other methods of acquiring new specimens, including salvage. Salvaged specimens, broadly defined as any specimen that was not intentionally killed for placement within a museum collection (Sweet 2010), come in many forms, including victims of roadkill, euthanizations at wildlife hospitals, and building collisions, among others (Sweet 2010). Yet, salvaged specimens are likely an inadequate replacement for active collecting. Many salvaged specimens arrive to the museum in poor condition (limiting the amount of information, such as intact tissue samples and complete skeletons, that can be obtained) and/or without any geolocating information (key for any study requiring information on the specimen’s geographic context when collected) (Sweet 2010). Further, unintentional taxonomic and geographic biases may be introduced. Most salvaged specimens are gathered from areas that are open and easily accessible to humans (Sweet 2010). Areas and habitats that are harder to access (e.g., areas away from roads, rivers, etc.) may thus be underrepresented in collections. Further, many species falling victim to primary salvage sources, such as building collisions, are primarily migrants, potentially leading to an overrepresentation of such species in collections and an underrepresentation of more sedentary species and populations (Schultz et al. 2021). Despite these concerns, no study has assessed the geographic or taxonomic extent covered by salvaged specimens. Here, I propose to conduct a case study on Californian birds within the collection of University of California (UC) Berkley’s Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, assessing the geographic and taxonomic coverage of salvaged versus actively collected museum specimens.

Data Requirement: Data are in the form of an Arctos dataset – obtained directly from UC Berkley – containing all avian specimens actively collected and salvaged within the state of California, United States, that are currently in the collection at UC Berkley’s Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. 

Analysis: The objectives of this study are to determine 1) the geographic distribution represented by and 2) the taxonomic representation in actively collected and salvaged specimens separately, and then assess whether salvaged specimens cover the same geographic and taxonomic extent as actively collected specimens. To determine geographic distribution in each group, specimens will be tallied according to which county they were originally collected/obtained from (recorded in the Arctos dataset). For each group (i.e., salvaged or actively collected), the percentage of specimens within the group associated with each county will be calculated. Then, to assess whether salvaged specimens mirror that of actively collected specimens, a chi-square goodness of fit will be conducted, using the percentages of the actively collected group as the expected values. To assess taxonomic representation, the same procedure used for geographic distribution will be employed, except specimens will be tallied according to genus, species, and subspecies, rather than county. Again, a chi-square goodness of fit will be conducted, using the percentages from the actively collected specimens as the expected values.
