## About Me

Hi all! Excited that I managed to (somehow) figure out this homework assignment :)
My name is Samantha Rutledge (I prefer Sam), and I am a first-year PhD student in the Mason Lab over in the LSU Museum of Natural Sciences. When I'm not hunched over a computer screen or in class, I enjoy filling my time with running, cycling, birdwatching, reading, and sketching, as well as trying new things (e.g., bouldering), even if I end up failing epically (again, bouldering).

```{bash engine.path = "C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe"}
R --version
```
