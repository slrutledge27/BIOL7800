## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

1.  Use the rvest R package to scrape the schedule and materials table into R from the course webpage (https://introdatasci.dlilab.com/schedule_materials/). Read the documentation of rvest so you get a better idea about the functions provided by rvest and their usages



```{r}
url_data <- "https://introdatasci.dlilab.com/schedule_materials/"
url_data %>% 
  read_html()
```
```{r}
css_selector <- "#main > table"
```
```{r}
x<- url_data %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_element(css = css_selector) %>% 
  html_table()
```


2. With the extracted data frame, create two new columns based on the Date column: month and day. month would be the month abbrevations from the Date column; day would be the numeric numbers from the Date column. Although you can use whatever approach to get this done (do not enter them by handâ€¦), I suggest you try to practice regular expression here (sub() or stringr::str_extract()).

3. With the data frame generated from Q2, use group_by() and summarise() to find out the number of lectures for each month, order the results by the number of lectures (high to low).

4. For the Topic column, split all values into words (hint: stringr::str_split()). Observe the values in the Topic column and use regular expression to specify the pattern in the stringr::str_split() or strsplit() function. Once this is done, you should get a list of list, you can use unlist() to convert it into a vector and name it as words. Use table() and sort() to find the top 5 most frequent words.



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
