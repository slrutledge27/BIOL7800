```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

## Question 1

```{r}
set.seed(12) # to be reproducible
A = matrix(data = runif(n = 1:500), nrow = 50, ncol = 10)
colnames(A) = paste("lake", 1:10, sep = "_")
```
```{r}
colMeans(A)
```

```{r}
for(i in 1:ncol(A)){
  print(mean(A[, i]))
}
```

## Question 2
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
